# Project2020
A RPG game for Pixel Art Lovers. Finally a game that doesn't judge you for playing LIKE YOU WANT... (That's our motto)

"Project2020" is only the working title, we'll come up with a real name when development is nearly finished!

The project itself is a 2D Pixel Art RPG Adventure Game made with the new Godot Game Engine. #WaitingForGodot

We release every month a video about my progress on YouTube:
