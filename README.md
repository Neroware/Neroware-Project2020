# Project2020
A RPG game for Pixel Art Lovers. Finally a game that doesn't judge you for playing LIKE YOU WANT... (That's our motto)

"Project2020" is only the working title, I already have some ideas for the name but I'm not quite sure for now.
I'm thinking about giving the game the title "Young Earth" but we'll see...

The project itself is a 2D Pixel Art RPG Adventure Game made with the new Godot Game Engine. #WaitingForGodot

I release every month a video about my progress on YouTube:
