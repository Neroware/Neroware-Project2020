# Project2020
A RPG game for Pixel Art Lovers. Finally a game that doesn't judge you for playing LIKE YOU WANT... (That's our motto)

"Project2020" is only the working title, we'll come up with a real name when development is nearly finished!

The project itself is a 2D Pixel Art RPG Adventure Game made with the new Godot Game Engine. #WaitingForGodot
Every month, we release a video about our progress on our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPEsDMd9W6qJwaMhJhkUFAg)
